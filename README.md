## Summary
Dish-It! is an application that allows you to upload pictures of your food online for others to view. Along with your picture you can give a rating of the food item as well as the locaiton you ate the food so others can go try it for themselves. The goal of this application is to give users the ability to see which food items are the best in their area as well as to see others' opinions on food.

This project was created using React, Mongoose, and an AWS S3 Container.

## How-To
Upon opening the application you will be on the Home Page. On the Home Page you can see a feed of posts from other users as well as a Navigation Bar up at the top and a Google Login button in the top right.

### Creating an account
From the Home Page, click on the Google **Login** button in the top right. (On mobile devices you will have to expand the Navigation Bar by pressing the menu button and find the Google **Login** button from there.) After clicking **Login**, you should receive a pop-up from Google. All you have to do is select your Google account and the application will login for you via Google.

**You must have a Google account to login.**

By logging in with your Google account, it ensures the login is secure and also allows you to better connect with other users. You do not have to worry though, your Google information is not used anywhere in the application. The only information from Google used in our application is your name and your Google profile picture.

### Uploading a picture
After logging in, a **Post Dish!** button should be visible at the bottom of the screen. Click on the button to pull up a form. From this form, please fill out the necessary information and select your picture. After clicking **Submit**, your feed will refresh and your post will be added to the feed!

### My Profile
On your Profile Page, which you can navigate to by clicking on the **My Profile** words on the top Navigation Bar, you can see a list of all of your posts! If you wish to delete a post, each post listing has a **Delete** button for you to click to do so.

### Search for dishes
By going to the Navigation Bar and clicking **Discover** and then selecting **Dishes** you will be taken to a Search Page. On this Search Page you can input the name of a dish and click **Submit**. After clicking submit, posts with the same dish name as your search will appear.

*Do note: the search is case sensitive.*

### Search by location
By clicking **Discover** on the Navigation Bar and then clicking **Locations**, you will be taken to a Search Page. On this Search Page you can input a location into the text box and then click **Submit**. Upon clicking submit, all posts from the searched location will appear.

*Do note: the search is case senstive but does have drop-down options for ease.*

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this application was my favorite project to work on. I was responsible for the back-end which also meant working with a technology not taught in the Full-Stack Bootcamp, the AWS S3 Container. It was challenging but necessary for our project to be able to save images to a database but I was able to accomplish this task with AWS. The rest of the back-end was created via Mongoose, which I found very engaging to use.

If given more time, I would like to make the searches more flexible by finding a way around needing case sensitive inputs. After that, a very nice feature to add would be the ability to add Friends.
